<!-- SEE IT IN ACTION: http://nicksweeting.com/502.html

Helpful page for developers that auto-refreshes when your development server is down,
so that you don't have to start your devserver, then switch to chrome and keep 
pressing Ctrl+R repeatedly as you wait for it to come up.

Add the following to your nginx.conf server block to use this page:

    server {
        listen 80 default;
        server_name  webserver.dev;             # make sure this is in /etc/hosts as    `127.0.0.1  webserver.dev`

        error_page  502  /error/502.html;       # use this file when nginx gets no response from the proxied devserver

        location ^~ /error/ {
            internal;
            alias /var/www/error/;              # change this to the location of the folder that contains 502.html
        }
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:8000;  # your dev server port
        }
    }
