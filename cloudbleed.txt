## Summary

https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare

Between 2016-09-22 - 2017-02-18 session tokens, passwords, private messages, API keys, and other sensitive data were leaked by Cloudflare to random requesters. Data was cached by search engines, and may have been collected by random adversaries over the past few months.

Requests to sites with the HTML rewrite features enabled triggered a pointer math bug. Once the bug was triggered the response would include data from ANY other Cloudflare proxy customer that happened to be in memory at the time. Meaning a request for a page with one of those features could include data from Uber or one of the many other customers that didn't use those features. So the potential impact is every single one of the sites using Cloudflare's proxy services (including HTTP & HTTPS proxy).

I compiled a list of all services using Cloudflare in order to allow operators to start checking caches for leaked data and users to request resetting of session tokens.  The list was collected from many sources, and naturally contained many false positives and negatives, but nevertheless served as a starting point.  It was eventually archived, but it made the news on several occasions.
