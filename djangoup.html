Stick this in the server {} block of your nginx.conf:
<br><br>
<pre>
error_page  502  /error/502.html;            # auto-refresh ever sec until runserver comes up

location ^~ /error/ {
    internal;
    alias /usr/local/etc/nginx/error/;
}

</pre>
<br><br>
Then make a directory /usr/local/etc/nginx/error and a file inside it called 502.html, and put this in it:
<br><br>

<iframe src="djangoup.txt"></iframe>

<br><br>
<b>Now when you first go to local.com and runserver isn't up yet, it'll autorefresh and load drchrono the moment runserver comes up, saving you time and keystrokes</b>
