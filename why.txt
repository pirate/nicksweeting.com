# Why I ask stupid questions on the internet

I often ask stupid questions that can be easily Googled.

Why? It's not because I'm too lazy to Google,
in fact most stupid questions I post in comments or tweets, 
I've already Google'd the answer to.

I ask them because:

1. If I had to ask, I know other people probably have the same question,
and it's nice to have the question & answer in the same comment thread
for posterity and so other people can learn the same way I did.

2. The person I'm asking probably has more context than I do about the subject,
and they might have a particularly insightful answer to my stupid question,
or be able to point me to a better resource than I'd be able to find on my own.

3. I often make incorrect assumtions, and I'd rather double-check in any
situation where I might have assumed something incorrect. Even if I've
Google'd it and found my assumption is wrong, maybe other people jumped
to the same conclusion and would appreciate reading the claryfing answers
to my dumb questions.

This is even something I take offline and do in real life. If I'm
in a situation with a group of people, and someone says something 
that isn't immediately obvious, I try to ask the clarifying questions 
that other people might be too shy to ask, even if I may know the 
answer.

More often than not, at least one or two other people probably had
the same question, and in many cases I get an answer I wasn't expecting!
